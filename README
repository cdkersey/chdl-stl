CHDL Standard Template Library
==============================

The CHDL STL is an auxilliary library of useful components that are considered
secondary to the CHDL core. These may be distributed alongside CHDL but retain
an identity as a separately-maintained, separately-tested entity, depending on
the core features provided by CHDL.
