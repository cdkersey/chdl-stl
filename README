CHDL Standard Template Library
==============================

The CHDL STL is an auxilliary library of useful components that are considered
secondary to the CHDL core. These may be distributed alongside CHDL but retain
an identity as a separately-maintained, separately-tested entity, depending on
the core features provided by CHDL.

1.1 Queue
---------

Description:

  A 2^SZ-entry queue

  template <typename T, unsigned SZ>
    T Queue(T input, node push, node pop, bvec<SZ + 1> &sz);

  Template parameters:
    T  - The type of objects in the queue.
    SZ - LOG2 of the number of entries in the queue.

  Inputs:
    input - The item to be enqueued during any cycle in which push is high.
    push  - The "push" command.
    pop   - The "pop" command.

  Outputs:
    sz      - Current number of items in the queue.
    returns - The head of the queue.

1.2 Stack
---------

Description:

  A 2^SZ-entry stack

  template <typename T, unsigned SZ>
    T Stack(T input, node push, node pop, bvec<SZ + 1> &sz);

  Template parameters:
    T  - The type of objects in the stack.
    SZ - LOG2 of the number of entries in the stack.

  Inputs:
    input - The item to be pushed during any cycle in which push is high.
    push  - The "push" command.
    pop   - The "pop" command.

  Outputs:
    sz      - Current number of items in the stack.
    returns - The contents of the top of the stack.
